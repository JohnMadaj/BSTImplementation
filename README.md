# Implementation - Binary Search Tree
Implementing a simple Binary Search Tree data structure from an abstract interface, complete with methods and tests.

Binary Search Tree is a data structure used to store comparable values in a top-to-bottom heirarchy, which generally allows for traversal with a time complexity of O(n), with n being the height of the tree. 

This implementation uses Nodes with char data values for readability sake, but generally a Comparable value will suffice to allow for flexible usage.
